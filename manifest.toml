cpe = "???" # FIXME: optional but recommended if relevant, this is meant to contain the Common Platform Enumeration, which is sort of a standard id for applications defined by the NIST. In particular, Yunohost may use this is in the future to easily track CVE (=security reports) related to apps. The CPE may be obtained by searching here: https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe/search. For example, for Nextcloud, the CPE is 'cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:nextcloud' (no need to include the version number)
fund = "???" # FIXME: optional but recommended (or remove if irrelevant / not applicable). This is meant to be an URL where people can financially support this app, especially when its development is based on volunteers and/or financed by its community. YunoHost may later advertise it in the webadmin.
